# Credit Redistribution Test Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive test suite for credit redistribution functionality in the Fantasy Football Auction App. The redistribution system ensures that when credits are saved or freed up, they are distributed fairly to remaining players, prioritizing the most expensive ones.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Purchase Redistribution Tests (`testCreditRedistribution`)
These tests verify the behavior when a player is acquired for less than their maximum bid, creating saved credits that need redistribution.

#### Test 1: Standard Purchase Redistribution
- **Scenario**: Player purchased for 5 credits less than max bid
- **Verifies**: 
  - Correct number of credits redistributed
  - Top N most expensive remaining players each receive +1 credit
  - Purchased player is excluded from redistribution

#### Test 2: Savings Exceed Remaining Players
- **Scenario**: Saved credits exceed the number of remaining players
- **Verifies**: Redistribution is capped by available player count
- **Example**: 25 saved credits but only 20 remaining players → only 20 credits redistributed

#### Test 3: Prioritization of Expensive Players
- **Scenario**: Only 3 credits to distribute among many players
- **Verifies**: Credits go to the 3 most expensive remaining players only
- **Algorithm**: Players sorted by bid (descending), top N receive +1 each

#### Test 4: Zero Saved Credits
- **Scenario**: Player purchased at exact max bid (no savings)
- **Verifies**: 
  - No redistribution occurs
  - All player bids remain unchanged

#### Test 5: Negative Saved Credits (Safety Check)
- **Scenario**: Edge case where saved credits might be negative
- **Verifies**: System safely handles with no redistribution

#### Test 6: Single Credit Saved
- **Scenario**: Only 1 credit saved
- **Verifies**: Single credit goes to the most expensive remaining player

#### Test 7: Purchased Player Exclusion
- **Scenario**: Verify purchased player doesn't receive redistributed credits
- **Verifies**: Purchased player's bid remains unchanged during redistribution

---

### 2. Loss Redistribution Tests (`testCreditRedistributionOnLoss`)
These tests verify the behavior when a player is lost to another team, freeing up their bid credits for redistribution.

#### Test 1: Standard Loss Redistribution
- **Scenario**: Player with 20+ bid is lost
- **Verifies**: 
  - Correct number of credits redistributed
  - Top N most expensive remaining players each receive +1 credit

#### Test 2: Loss with More Credits than Players
- **Scenario**: Lost player has 100 bid but only 15 players remain
- **Verifies**: Redistribution capped at 15 (one per remaining player)

#### Test 3: Prioritization of Expensive Players
- **Scenario**: Lost player with 3-credit bid
- **Verifies**: Top 3 most expensive players get the credits

#### Test 4: Zero Bid Player Loss
- **Scenario**: Lost player has 0 bid
- **Verifies**: 
  - No redistribution occurs
  - All player bids unchanged

#### Test 5: One Credit Player Loss
- **Scenario**: Lost player has 1 credit bid
- **Verifies**: Single credit goes to most expensive player

---

### 3. Integration Loss Scenarios (`testLossScenarios`)
These tests verify complete workflows involving losses and purchases.

#### Test 1: Manual Player Loss
- **Scenario**: Player lost via "Player Lost" button
- **Verifies**: 
  - Roster size decreases by 1
  - Credits correctly redistributed to top players

#### Test 2: Bid Limit Reached
- **Scenario**: Player lost because current offer reached max bid
- **Verifies**: 
  - Redistribution within limits
  - Optimal distribution calculation

#### Test 3: Multiple Sequential Losses
- **Scenario**: Lose 2 players back-to-back
- **Verifies**: 
  - Total bids conserved correctly
  - Cumulative redistribution accurate

#### Test 4: Loss Followed by Purchase
- **Scenario**: Lose a player, then acquire another with savings
- **Verifies**: Combined redistribution logic works correctly

## Redistribution Algorithm

### Core Logic
```
redistributeCredits(savedCredits, excludedPlayer):
    1. Filter out excluded player (just purchased)
    2. Sort remaining players by bid (highest first)
    3. Calculate credits to distribute: min(savedCredits, remainingPlayers.length)
    4. For each of top N players:
       - Add +1 to their bid
    5. Return number of credits distributed

redistributeCreditsOnLoss(lostPlayer):
    1. Filter out lost player
    2. Sort remaining players by bid (highest first)
    3. Calculate credits to distribute: min(lostPlayer.bid, remainingPlayers.length)
    4. For each of top N players:
       - Add +1 to their bid
    5. Return number of credits distributed
```

### Key Properties
- **Even Distribution**: Each receiving player gets exactly +1 credit
- **Priority**: Most expensive players receive credits first
- **Cap**: Maximum credits distributed = min(available_credits, remaining_players)
- **Exclusion**: Purchased/lost players are excluded from receiving credits

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Unlock the app with the correct passphrase
3. Open browser console

### Execute Tests
```javascript
// Run all tests
runTests()

// Run specific test
FantasyTester.testCreditRedistribution()
FantasyTester.testCreditRedistributionOnLoss()
FantasyTester.testLossScenarios()
```

### Expected Output
```
✅ Test passed: Description
❌ Test failed: Description with error details
ℹ️  Info: Progress updates
⚠️  Warning: Non-critical issues
```

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators
- All assertions pass (✅ symbols)
- No warnings about insufficient data
- Original state properly restored after tests

### Common Failures
- **Insufficient roster**: Need at least 5 players for comprehensive tests
- **App not unlocked**: Must unlock app before running tests
- **State corruption**: Tests should restore original state; if not, reload page

---

## Edge Cases Covered

1. **Zero credits**: No redistribution needed
2. **Single credit**: Goes to single most expensive player
3. **More credits than players**: Capped at player count
4. **Empty roster**: Safe handling, no crashes
5. **Negative values**: Safely ignored
6. **Player exclusion**: Purchased/lost players don't receive credits
7. **Sequential operations**: Multiple losses/purchases in sequence
8. **Combined operations**: Loss then purchase redistribution

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Tests
- Performance testing with large rosters (100+ players)
- Concurrent purchase/loss operations
- Role-specific redistribution priorities
- Budget constraints with redistribution
- Undo operations with redistribution reversal

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Track total credits before/after operations
- Verify roster integrity after each operation
- Log redistribution events for audit trail
- Alert on unexpected redistribution patterns

## Credits Conservation Principle

The system maintains credit conservation:
```
Total_Credits_Before = Sum(all_player_bids) + Budget_Spent

After Loss:
Total_Credits_After = Sum(remaining_bids) + Budget_Spent
Where: Sum(remaining_bids) = Sum(original_bids) - lost_bid + redistributed

After Purchase with Savings:
Total_Credits_After = Sum(remaining_bids) + Budget_Spent + purchase_price
Where: Sum(remaining_bids) = Sum(original_bids) + redistributed_savings
```

The tests verify this conservation principle holds across all operations.
