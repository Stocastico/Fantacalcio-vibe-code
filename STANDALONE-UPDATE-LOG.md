# Fantacalcio Standalone Update Log

## Update Date: October 2, 2025

### Summary
Updated `fantacalcio-standalone.html` with:
1. **Version 8 obfuscated player data** from `players.js`
2. **Comprehensive credit redistribution tests** from `test-suite.js`

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Player Data (OBF String)
- **Status**: âœ… Already using v8 data
- **Passphrase**: "dammi un Braulio"
- **Source**: `fantacalcio-obf-snippet-v8.js` and `players.js`

### 2. Test Suite Updates

#### A. `testCreditRedistribution()` - **UPDATED**
Enhanced from 1 basic test to **7 comprehensive tests**:

1. **Standard purchase redistribution** - Player bought for less than max bid
2. **Savings exceed remaining players** - Edge case handling
3. **Prioritization verification** - Most expensive players get credits first
4. **Zero saved credits** - No redistribution when price equals max bid
5. **Negative saved credits** - Safety check for invalid inputs
6. **Single credit saved** - Minimal redistribution test
7. **Purchased player exclusion** - Verify excluded from receiving credits

#### B. `testCreditRedistributionOnLoss()` - **UPDATED**
Enhanced from 3 basic tests to **5 comprehensive tests**:

1. **Standard loss redistribution** - Player lost with proper credit distribution
2. **Loss with excessive credits** - More credits than available players
3. **Prioritization verification** - Top 3 most expensive get credits
4. **Zero bid player loss** - No redistribution for 0-bid players
5. **Single credit player loss** - Minimal loss redistribution

#### C. `testLossScenarios()` - **UPDATED**
Enhanced from 2 tests to **4 comprehensive integration tests**:

1. **Manual player loss** - Via "Player Lost" button with full verification
2. **Bid limit reached** - Player lost when offer reaches max bid
3. **Multiple sequential losses** - Cumulative redistribution testing
4. **Loss followed by purchase** - Combined operations workflow

---

## Test Coverage Improvements

### Before Update
- **Total tests**: ~12 assertions
- **Edge cases**: Minimal
- **Integration tests**: Basic

### After Update
- **Total tests**: ~35+ assertions
- **Edge cases**: Comprehensive (zero, negative, single credit, excessive values)
- **Integration tests**: Multi-step workflows with state verification
- **Verification**: Bid totals, player prioritization, state conservation

---

## Key Features Tested

### Credit Redistribution Algorithm
```
1. Filter out purchased/lost player
2. Sort remaining players by bid (highest first)
3. Calculate: min(available_credits, remaining_players)
4. Distribute +1 credit to top N players
5. Return number of credits distributed
```

### Properties Verified
- âœ… Even distribution (+1 per player)
- âœ… Priority to expensive players
- âœ… Capped by player count
- âœ… Exclusion of purchased/lost players
- âœ… State conservation across operations
- âœ… Edge case safety (zero, negative, excessive values)

## File Structure

### Updated File
- `fantacalcio-standalone.html` (1,713 lines)
  - Lines 478-481: OBF v8 data with comments
  - Lines 1099-1280: Enhanced `testCreditRedistribution()`
  - Lines 1284-1440: Enhanced `testCreditRedistributionOnLoss()`
  - Lines 1440-1600: Enhanced `testLossScenarios()`

### Source Files
- `players.js` - v8 OBF data
- `test-suite.js` - Comprehensive test suite
- `fantacalcio-obf-snippet-v8.js` - v8 snippet reference

## Usage Instructions

### Opening the App
1. Open `fantacalcio-standalone.html` in any modern browser
2. Enter passphrase: **"dammi un Braulio"**
3. Click "Sblocca" to unlock the app

### Running Tests
```javascript
// In browser console after unlocking:

// Run all tests
runTests()

// Run specific tests
FantasyTester.testCreditRedistribution()
FantasyTester.testCreditRedistributionOnLoss()
FantasyTester.testLossScenarios()
```

### Expected Test Output
```
âœ… Test passed: Purchase redistribution count matches expected
âœ… Test passed: Saved credits distributed to most expensive remaining players (+1 each)
âœ… Test passed: Loss redistribution count matches expected
âœ… Test passed: Credits distributed to most expensive players (+1 each)
...
Test Results: XX/XX passed
All tests passed! ðŸŽ‰
```

## Technical Notes

### Redistribution Functions
Both functions follow the same pattern:

**`redistributeCredits(savedCredits, purchasedPlayerName)`**
- Used when player acquired for less than max bid
- Excludes the purchased player
- Returns number of credits redistributed

**`redistributeCreditsOnLoss(lostPlayer)`**
- Used when player lost to another team
- Excludes the lost player
- Returns number of credits redistributed

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Empty roster** - Returns 0, no errors
2. **Zero/negative credits** - No redistribution
3. **More credits than players** - Capped at player count
4. **Single player remaining** - Proper single-player handling
5. **Player exclusion** - Purchased/lost players never receive credits
