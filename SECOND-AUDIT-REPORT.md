**Tests Added:** 25+ new assertions across 2 new test modules  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All critical calculation bugs fixed and tested

## üî¥ NEWLY DISCOVERED CRITICAL BUGS

### **BUG #1: Player Availability Not Validated Before Purchase**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Purchase of already-lost players, data corruption

**Description:**  
The original code only checked if a player exists in the ORIGINAL list, but didn't verify they're still in the current roster. This allowed purchasing players who were already lost or removed through the "Player Lost" button.

**Example Scenario:**
```
1. User clicks "Player Lost" on Player A
2. Player A removed from roster
3. User manually types Player A's name and attempts purchase
4. OLD CODE: Purchase succeeds (player in ORIGINAL ‚úì)
5. Result: Player purchased but NOT in roster = CORRUPTION
```

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Added critical roster check
const playerInRoster = roster ? roster.find(p => norm(p.name) === norm(name)) : null;
if (!playerInRoster) {
    out.innerHTML = `‚ùå <span class="warn"></span>`;
    out.querySelector('.warn').textContent = 
        `"${name}" non √® pi√π disponibile (gi√† acquistato o andato ad altri).`;
    return false;
}
```

**Test Coverage:**
- `testCreditCalculations()` - Test 6: Cannot purchase player not in roster
- `testRosterConsistency()` - Test 1: Roster size tracking after removal

---

### **BUG #2: Using ORIGINAL Instead of Current ROSTER for Bid Calculations**
**Severity:** MAJOR  
**Impact:** Incorrect saved credits calculation after redistribution

**Description:**  
When calculating saved credits and overpayment warnings, the code used `playerInList` (from ORIGINAL) instead of `playerInRoster` (current state). After redistribution, player bids change, but ORIGINAL remains static. This could lead to:

- Wrong "over bid" warnings
- Incorrect saved credits calculation
- Misleading user feedback

**Example:**
```
Player A original bid: 30
After redistribution: 32 (got +2 from other purchases)
Purchase price: 31

OLD CODE:
  Uses ORIGINAL (30)
  savedCredits = 30 - 31 = -1 ‚Üí 0
  Warning: "over bid" ‚ùå WRONG

NEW CODE:
  Uses ROSTER (32)
  savedCredits = 32 - 31 = 1 ‚úì
  No warning, correct!
```

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Use ROSTER player data (current state) not ORIGINAL
const over = playerInRoster.bid && priceInt > playerInRoster.bid;
const savedCredits = playerInRoster.bid ? Math.max(0, playerInRoster.bid - priceInt) : 0;

// Added originalBid tracking for auditing
const purchaseInfo = {
    name,
    price: priceInt,
    savedCredits,
    originalBid: playerInRoster.bid, // Store current bid at purchase time
    redistributionSnapshot: null
};
```

**Test Coverage:**
- `testCreditCalculations()` - Test 2: SavedCredits calculation accuracy
- `testCreditCalculations()` - Test 5: Player bid updates reflected correctly

---

### **BUG #3: No Validation of Credit Conservation**
**Severity:** MAJOR  
**Impact:** Potential credit inflation/deflation going undetected

**Description:**  
The system had NO tests to verify that the total credits in the system remain consistent across operations. Credits should be conserved:

**Credit Conservation Law:**
```
Total Credits = Sum of all player bids in roster

After purchase with redistribution:
New Total = Old Total - (player bid) + (redistribution amount)

After loss with redistribution:
New Total = Old Total - (lost player bid) + (redistribution amount)
```

Without validation, bugs could silently create or destroy credits.

**Fix Applied:**
Added comprehensive `testCreditCalculations()` module with 7 tests:
1. Credit conservation during purchase redistribution
2. SavedCredits calculation accuracy (multiple scenarios)
3. Redistribution capped by player count
4. Budget tracking across multiple operations
5. Player bid updates during redistribution
6. Roster availability validation
7. Remaining budget calculation

**Test Coverage:**
- `testCreditCalculations()` - All 7 tests validate credit conservation
- Tests verify total credits before/after every operation

---

### **BUG #4: Roster Consistency Not Validated**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Corrupted roster state could go undetected

**Description:**  
No tests verified that the roster maintains integrity:
- No duplicate players
- All players have required fields (name, role, bid)
- All bids are non-negative
- Roster size tracked correctly

These invariants are CRITICAL for auction accuracy but were never validated.

**Fix Applied:**
Added comprehensive `testRosterConsistency()` module with 5 tests:
1. Roster size consistency after operations
2. No duplicate players
3. All players have required fields
4. All player bids non-negative
5. Roster validity after loss redistribution

**Test Coverage:**
- `testRosterConsistency()` - 5 comprehensive validation tests

---

### **BUG #5: Purchase Data Structure Inconsistency**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Potential future bugs when accessing purchase history

**Description:**  
The purchase object structure evolved but wasn't fully documented or validated:

**Original:**
```javascript
{ name: string, price: number }
```

**After First Fix:**
```javascript
{ 
    name: string, 
    price: number, 
    savedCredits: number,
    redistributionSnapshot: array 
}
```

**After Second Fix:**
```javascript
{ 
    name: string, 
    price: number, 
    savedCredits: number,
    originalBid: number,  // NEW: for audit trail
    redistributionSnapshot: array 
}
```

CSV export and other features accessing purchase history could break if they assume old structure.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `originalBid` field to track player bid at time of purchase
- Updated `testDataIntegrity()` to validate new field exists
- CSV export already uses only `name` and `price` so it's safe

**Test Coverage:**
- `testDataIntegrity()` - Test 2: Validates all 5 fields in purchase object

---

## üìä New Test Coverage

### Test Module: `testCreditCalculations()` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Validate all credit calculation math is accurate

**Tests Added:**

1. **Credit Conservation During Purchase**
   - Verifies: Total credits = Old total - player bid + redistribution
   - Validates: Credit conservation law holds

2. **SavedCredits Calculation Accuracy**
   - Tests 4 scenarios: below bid, near bid, exact bid, over bid
   - Validates: Math.max(0, bid - price) works correctly

3. **Redistribution Capped by Player Count**
   - Tests: 1000 credit redistribution with limited players
   - Validates: Can't redistribute more than available players

4. **Budget Tracking Across Multiple Operations**
   - Tests: Purchase ‚Üí Purchase ‚Üí Undo ‚Üí Undo
   - Validates: Budget tracked accurately at each step

5. **Player Bid Updates During Redistribution**
   - Verifies: Top player gets +1 after 1-credit redistribution
   - Validates: Redistribution actually modifies player bids

6. **Roster Availability Validation**
   - Tests: Purchase rejected for removed player
   - Validates: Critical roster check works

7. **Remaining Budget Calculation**
   - Tests: START_BUDGET - spent at multiple points
   - Validates: Budget math is correct

---

### Test Module: `testRosterConsistency()` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Validate roster maintains integrity across all operations

**Tests Added:**

1. **Roster Size Tracking**
   - Verifies: Size decreases by 1 after purchase+removal
   - Validates: Roster.length tracked correctly

2. **No Duplicate Players**
   - Tests: All player names are unique
   - Validates: Set size equals array length

3. **All Players Have Required Fields**
   - Checks: Every player has name, role, bid
   - Validates: Data structure integrity

4. **All Bids Non-Negative**
   - Verifies: No player has bid < 0
   - Validates: Redistribution doesn't create negative bids

5. **Roster Valid After Loss Redistribution**
   - Tests: Player removal + redistribution
   - Validates: All players still have valid bids
