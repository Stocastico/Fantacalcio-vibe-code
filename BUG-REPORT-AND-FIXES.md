## üî¥ Critical Bugs Found

### 1. **Undo Purchase Doesn't Restore Credit Redistribution**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect player valuations

**Description:**  
When a player is purchased for less than their maximum bid, saved credits are redistributed to the most expensive remaining players (+1 each). However, when using the "Undo" button, only the purchase is removed and the spent budget restored - **the redistributed credits remain on other players**. This causes permanent inflation of player bids.

**Example:**
```
Initial state: Player A (bid: 30), Player B (bid: 25), Player C (bid: 20)
Purchase Player A for 25 ‚Üí Save 5 credits ‚Üí Redistribute to B (+1) and C (+1)
After purchase: Player B (bid: 26), Player C (bid: 21)
After undo: Player B (bid: 26), Player C (bid: 21) ‚Üê WRONG! Should be 25 and 20
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `addPurchase()` to save a snapshot of all player bids before redistribution
- Modified `undoPurchase()` to restore bids from snapshot when rolling back
- Added `redistributionSnapshot` field to purchase data structure

**Test Coverage:**
- `testUndoFunctionality()` - Test 1: Undo with redistribution rollback
- `testUndoFunctionality()` - Test 2: Undo without redistribution
- `testUndoFunctionality()` - Test 3: Multiple sequential undos

---

### 2. **Player Removed from Roster Before Purchase Validation**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Data loss, roster corruption

**Description:**  
In the `btnPlayerWon` event handler, the player is removed from the roster BEFORE calling `addPurchase()`. If the purchase fails (budget exceeded, duplicate player, etc.), the player is permanently lost from the roster without being added to purchases.

**Example:**
```
User clicks "Player Won" with insufficient budget
‚Üí addPurchase() fails and returns false
‚Üí Player already removed from roster
‚Üí Player is neither in roster nor in purchases = DATA LOSS
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Reordered logic to call `addPurchase()` FIRST
- Only remove player from roster if `addPurchase()` returns success
- Added proper error handling with sanitized messages

**Test Coverage:**
- `testComplexWorkflows()` - Test 1: Complete auction workflow validation
- `testEdgeCases()` - Test 6: Budget overflow prevention

---

### 3. **HTML Injection Vulnerability in Player Names**
**Severity:** HIGH (Security)  
**Impact:** XSS vulnerability, display corruption

**Description:**  
Player names are inserted into the DOM using `innerHTML` without sanitization. If a player name contains HTML/JavaScript code (malicious or accidental), it will be executed.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Vulnerable code:
out.innerHTML = `‚úÖ Aggiunto "${name}" per ${priceInt}`;

// If name = "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"
// The script executes
```

**Fix Applied:**
- Use `textContent` for untrusted content
- Create DOM elements programmatically instead of string concatenation
- Sanitize all user-supplied data before display

**Test Coverage:**
- Manual security testing required (automated tests cannot detect XSS)
- `testDataIntegrity()` validates data structure integrity

---

### 4. **Reset Button Doesn't Clear Auction State**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** UI inconsistency, user confusion

**Description:**  
When the reset button is clicked, the roster is restored to original but if an auction is in progress:
- `currentAuctionPlayer` remains set
- Auction section stays visible with stale player info
- User can attempt operations on a player that may have changed state

**Fix Applied:**
- Clear `currentAuctionPlayer` and `lastSuggestedBid` on reset
- Hide auction section on reset
- Added null checks for auction section element

**Test Coverage:**
- Manual UI testing recommended
- `testComplexWorkflows()` indirectly validates state cleanup

---

## üü° Major Issues

### 5. **Decimal/Fractional Price Handling Unclear**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** User confusion, unexpected behavior

**Description:**  
Users can enter decimal prices like "10.7" which are automatically rounded to 11, but:
- No feedback shown to user about rounding
- Purchase message shows original price without adjustment notice

**Fix Applied:**
- Added console log when price adjustment occurs
- Price validation already rounds correctly
- Enhanced tests to verify rounding behavior

**Test Coverage:**
- `testEdgeCases()` - Test 1: Decimal/fractional prices
- Verifies prices are rounded to integers correctly

---

### 6. **Missing Validation for Empty Roster**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Potential runtime errors

**Description:**  
If all players are purchased or lost, roster becomes empty. The random player button doesn't check for this condition before attempting to select.

**Current Code:**
```javascript
if (!roster || roster.length === 0) {
    out.innerHTML = "‚ùå Lista vuota: nessun giocatore rimanente.";
    return;
}
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already handled correctly! No fix needed.

**Test Coverage:**
- `testEdgeCases()` validates empty roster handling

---

## üü¢ Minor Issues & Improvements

### 7. **No Validation for Player Object Structure**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Potential null reference errors

**Description:**  
Code assumes all player objects have `name`, `role`, and `bid` properties but doesn't validate structure.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `testDataIntegrity()` module to validate data structures
- Defensive checks for required fields in purchase objects

**Test Coverage:**
- `testDataIntegrity()` - Test 2: Purchase data structure validation
- Checks for required fields: name, price, savedCredits, redistributionSnapshot

---

### 8. **Missing Test Coverage**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Untested code paths

**Original Coverage:**
- 8 test modules
- ~35 assertions
- Missing: undo, edge cases, workflows, CSV export

**New Coverage:**
- 13 test modules  
- **60+ assertions**
- Added:
  - `testUndoFunctionality()` - 8 assertions
  - `testEdgeCases()` - 10 assertions
  - `testComplexWorkflows()` - 12 assertions
  - `testDataIntegrity()` - 6 assertions
  - `testCSVExport()` - 3 assertions
